    <p class="text desc">An elderly lady residing in Turkey served this Russian cabbage borscht to a friend of ours while he was in that country several years ago. She has since passed away, but her recipe lives on. It is the best Borscht recipe I've ever enjoyed. Serve topped with sour cream, extra dill weed, and chopped fresh tomatoes.</p>
